        <h1>It's like finding your way home</h1>
        <p><img class="float-left-image" src="img/trees-01.png">Suppose that someone drops you in a random location in the woods a few miles from your town. Your goal is to find your way home. 
        This is a bit like math. To solve a math problem you need to apply some <em>steps</em> and reach a <em>goal</em>, the solution. In the woods, you need to take some <em>steps</em> and reach a <em>goal</em>, your home.</p>
				<p><span class="lead-in">Lost in the woods,</span> you might feel confusion.</span> This is normal. Would you blame yourself for feeling confused? Probably not; you understand that anyone would feel confused in this situation.</p>
		<h2>You begin your journey</h2>
		<p><img src="img/walking-02.png" class="float-left-image">In spite of feeling confused, you know that you have to start walking, in some direction, even if you're not sure where. You need to explore.</p>
        <p>Suppose you walk north, up a slope. You reach a high ridge and recognize the land around you. You realize that your house is in the other direction, south. </p>
        <p>So you  head south.  Was it a waste of time to go north? Maybe, maybe not. You probably wouldn't get stressed about it. After all, that gave you the opportunity to see the land around you. Wrong turns and dead ends are understandable; no one expects to get home from the woods in one shot.</p>
        <p>Now you know your town is south and you also know it's downhill. As you walk, you come to a river. You know that rivers flow downhill, so it seems like a good bet to follow it. This means you are using your knowedge of rivers to to give you a clue which way to go.</p>
        <p>Pretty soon you recognize a big motel sign near your home. It's a <em>landmark</em> that tells you the goal is near. Soon you are home!</p>
		<blockquote> <div class="quote-title">INTERESTING FACT</div>The word “landmark” is from the old English “<em>landmearc,” </em>meaning “an object in the landscape that serves as a guide in the direction of one’s course.” </blockquote>
        <h2>So how about math?</h2>
        <p>Your trip in the woods involved these things: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You felt <em>confusion.</em></li>
          <li>But you <em>went ahead and started</em> walking.</li>
          <li>You came to a dead end, but <em>you learned from it</em>.</li>
          <li>You <em>know something about the terrain</em>: you know that rivers run downhill.</li>
          <li>You <em>recognized a landmark</em> near your home.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So let's consider math. What happens when you encounter a difficult math problem?</p>
        <p>You might feel confusion. This can be scary. Very often, teachers demand a correct answer quickly. A lot can be riding on a math test. You might think that  confusion is a sign of something deeply wrong. Maybe you tell yourself you should have listened better in class, or have studied more. Maybe you  feel plain bad at it.</p>
        <p>Yet confusion doesn't have to be a problem. You can work though it. It's even a good sign! It means you are going outside your comfort zone. It means you are about to have new insights and deeper understanding. </p>
        <p>In the woods, you know confusion is normal. That's true about math, too. You can learn to appreciate that fact.</p>
        <p>For more help with confusion, see <a href="confusion.html">this page</a>. </p>
        <h2>That first step in math</h2>
        <p>After acknowledging the confusion, you need to take a first step. You may be concerned it's wrong. But <em>the first step can be in any direction.</em> </p>
		<blockquote><div class="quote-title">GOOD QUOTE</div>“You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step”. <div class="quote-sig">Martin Luther King, Jr.</div> </blockquote>
        <p>How do you choose a step? Think about recent topics you've learned in class. Write one down and see if it fits the problem. Give it a try. It doesn't matter if it's not the right idea.  The act of choosing an idea and writing it down will <em>trigger an association</em>. It will make you think of something else. And that will trigger another association and so on. Taking that first step starts the ball rolling.</p>
        <p>After a few steps you may hit a dead end and find you went in the wrong direction. In the woods, this gave you an opportunity to learn about the land around you and that gave you a chance to get straightened out.</p>
        <p>It's the same in math. Here is an article about <a href="mistakes.html">learning from your mistakes.</a></p>
        <h2>Landmarks in math</h2>
        <p>In the woods, you eventually came to a big hotel sign and you knew your home was near.</p>
        <p>There are landmarks in math too. Suppose you are asked to solve the following equation for \(x\):</p>
        <p> $$ \begin{aligned}  7x + 3               & =             5x +7  & \phantom{xxx}  & \text{solve this for $x$} \\
          -5x \phantom{{}+3{}}  & \phantom{=}  -5x  & \phantom{xxx}  & \text{subtract $5x$ from each side} \\
          2x + 3               & =           \phantom{5x+{}}  7  & \phantom{xxx} & \text{an equation with $x$ on the left side only}
          \end{aligned}
          $$ </p>
        <p> Here, after subtracting \(5x\) from each side, you get an equation that has \(x\) on one side only. If you know algebra, you know this is an important pattern: you are getting closer to the solution. So it's a landmark. As you learn new math, I encourage you to keep an eye open for landmark patterns. </p>
