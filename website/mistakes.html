				<h1>Mistakes are okay</h1>
				<p> Walt Disney was a fabulously successful creator of stories, images, and characters. But early in his life, he was fired by a newspaper editor because "he lacked imagination and had no good ideas." Several of his early businesses went bankrupt.</p>

				<p>Bill Gates is one of the most creative and intelligent people alive. But he dropped out of Harvard, and his first business venture failed.</p>

				<p>Einstein, despite his phenomenal abilities at math and science, was not good with language. He didn't speak until he was four and didn't read until he was seven.</p>

				<p>These people's lives are a journey. Over a long span, they developed skill and knowledge. They created things that caught fire and grew. But they had setbacks along the way.</p>

				<p>Perhaps you have a dream for your life. Maybe you'd like to develop a skill like music or sports or art. Maybe you'd like to raise a family. Maybe grow a business. All of these things are a journey. You will have ups and downs. You will make mistakes.</p>

				<p><em>What our schools should teach is this:</em> a mistake, such as a wrong answer on a test, is not the end of the road. You can carry on and still reach your goals. But a conventional school responds to a wrong answer by giving you a lower grade. In high school, that means it's harder to get into college. Lower grades in college may impact your job search. </p>
				
				<p>No wonder students feel anxiety and pressure to be right all the time!</p>

				<p>This creates a misleading impression about the nature of life. In a conventional school, you have homework and tests. You spend a short time with each problem, and answer it. Your answer is right or wrong. When the test is done, you are left with a grade.</p>

				<p>In this environment, it's harder to see the <em>process of learning,</em>the <em>process of life</em>&mdash;when most schools put all the emphasis on the <em>answer.</em></p>

				<p>The idea that things are black-and-white, right-and-wrong, is compelling and attention-grabbing. Politicians buy into it&mdash;they think they can improve schooling by administering tests. Some teachers buy into it&mdash;it simplifies their job description: just get students to pass the test. And the students believe it, because what reason do they have to question the authority figures?</p>

				<h2>Another way of looking at mistakes</h2>

				<p>What happens when you spend a few minutes with a math problem? You go on a little journey. You start by looking at the problem and getting a sense of what topics it involves. You take some steps. Eventually you reach an answer.</p>

				<p>You may take some wrong turns along the way. Perhaps your first few steps are in the wrong direction. Maybe you try to apply the quadratic formula, but soon realize that the equation is not quadratic. That's okay. It doesn't mean you won't get to the right answer eventually.</p>

				<p>Over a span of many years, people like Disney, Bill Gates, and Einstein got off to a rocky start but made it eventually. In a similar way, your journey of only a few minutes with this problem might start out rocky&mdash;you feel confused, or make a mistake&mdash;but you can still find your way to the answer just fine.</p>

				<p>In the remainder of this essay, I'll make four main points about mistakes.</p>
       <ul>
			<li>Mistakes are a part of life.</li>
			<li>Mistakes don't determine where you end up.</li>
			<li>You can affirm yourself for being aware of a mistake.</li>
			<li>You can learn from mistakes.</li>
		</ul>
<h2>Mistakes are a part of life</h2>
				<blockquote><div class="quote-title">GOOD QUOTE</div>A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.<div class="quote-sig">Albert Einstein</div></blockquote> 
				<p>Mistakes are going to happen. It does no good to beat yourself up and worry. Of course, that's easy for me to say. Many people have deep habits of blaming themselves for failure. But it helps when you can see that mistakes are not the end.</p>
<h2>Mistakes don't determine where you end up</h2>
				<p>Consider the examples of Disney, Bill Gates, and Einstein: at the beginning, their lives took some wrong turns. But that put no limitations on their ultimate accomplishments. In the same way, as you work a math problem, you may need a few tries to get it right. It just doesn't matter if you are initially confused or wrong&mdash;the important thing is to stick with it.</p>
<h2>You can affirm yourself for being aware of a mistake</h2>
				<p>I always recommend baby steps. One baby step after a mistake is simply to recognize it. &ldquo;Hey, I see my mistake,&rdquo; you say to yourself. Never underestimate how important this is. Seeing your mistakes is the first step toward fixing them.</p>
        <h2>You can learn from mistakes</h2>
				<blockquote> <div class="quote-title">GOOD QUOTE</div>There are no mistakes in jazz, only missed opportunities. <div class="quote-sig">Various attribution including Ben Sidron and Stefon Harris</div></blockquote>
				<p>Jazz musicians, while improvising, often find that a &ldquo;wrong note&rdquo; leads them in a wholly unexpected direction, creating fresh music.</p>
				<blockquote><div class="quote-title">GOOD QUOTE</div>Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.<div class="quote-sig">Bill Gates</div></blockquote>
				<h2>Some scientific discoveries happened by accident</h2>
				<p>Some scientific innovations happened when the scientist wasn't expecting them.</p>
        <h3>Post-it Notes</h3>
				<p>Dr. Spencer Silver at 3M was trying to create extra-strong adhesives, but one of his formulations was especially weak. When a fellow engineer happened to remark he'd like a <em>removable</em> bookmark, Dr. Silver realized his weak adhesive had a good use!</p>
        <h3>The matchstick</h3>
				<p>In 1827, English pharmacist John Walker was stirring a pot of chemicals that included antimony sulfide and potassium chlorate (the components of a modern matchstick head) and noticed a dried lump at the end of his mixing stick. When he tried to scratch it off, it burst into flames, demonstrating a new way to start a fire!</p>

        <h2>An algebra example</h2>
				<p>Let's take an example of solving an algebra problem with this attitude in mind. You may have already mastered this kind of problem, so think back to when it was new.</p>

You are asked to solve for $x$:

\[ 2x + 8 + 3x = 6x \]

Baby steps. First, just recognizing what is present. There's the variable $x$. Look for other variables—you see none. Celebrate your awareness of these facts.

Perhaps you recall from a class that you are supposed to subtract an $x$ term from both sides. Here you see several terms with $x$. Let's pick one and try it. Let's see where it leads.

We are not sure if this is the right approach, but because <strong><em>we acknowledge that mistakes are part of life,</em></strong> we don't have to be afraid of making one.

So we'll subtract $2x$ from each side:

\[ \begin{system}
2x &amp; + &amp; 8 &amp; + &amp; 3x &amp; = &amp; 6x \\
-2x &amp;  &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; -2x \\
&amp; &amp; 8 &amp; + &amp; 3x &amp; = &amp; 4x
\end{system} \]

Does this look like the answer?

At this point <em>you notice an</em> $x$ <em>term on each side of the equals sign.</em> You now remember that you are supposed to get $x$ on <em>one side of the equation only.</em>

So here you can <em><strong>acknowledge that it doesn't look like you expected.</strong></em> You don't even have to call it a mistake, because there may be a way forward. <em><strong>Celebrate being aware of this.</strong></em>

Suppose that looking at this equation triggers a memory of something you saw in class. Your teacher said to combine the $x$'s on each side of the equation <em>first</em>. When you have this memory, <em><strong>you are learning from your mistakes. </strong></em>Don't underestimate how important this is: you are doing a kind of innovation, you are making a discovery. Even if it's something that the teacher thinks is easy, or the other students get, <em><strong>you are engaged in a creative activity: creating your own wisdom and understanding. </strong></em>

Now you know you are supposed to change the equation into

\[ \begin{system}

2x + &amp; 8 + 3x &amp; = 6x &amp; {} &amp;  \phantom{xxx} &amp; \text{ (original equation)} \\

&amp; 8 + 5x &amp; = 6x  &amp; {}  &amp;                                    &amp; \text{(combine the 2x and 3x)}

\end{system} \]

Now you try the subtraction again, this time with $5x$:

\[\begin{system}

8 &amp;  +  &amp; 5x &amp; = &amp; 6x \\

&amp;   -  &amp;  5x &amp;  &amp;    - 5x \\

8 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; x

\end{system} \]

Now you see the answer, $x$ is 8!

This is only one example of how a problem might go, but it illustrates that you can make a mistake, then learn from it, and still reach the solution.
