        <h1>Coping with confusion</h1>
        <p>Everyone has a deep need to feel oriented to the world&mdash;to know where you are, what's going on, and to feel confident you can handle whatever comes next. The emotion of confusion, therefore, is deeply threatening. </p>
        <p> People will go to great lengths to avoid feeling confusion. They might take only easy classes in school, or choose a career so that their workday will be routine and have nothing complicated. People will even deceive themselves into thinking they understand a situation, psychological research shows, to avoid feeling confused. </p>
        <p>A student in a math class can feel trapped&mdash;no way out. You can't avoid taking the math class if you want to graduate.</p>
        <p>The good news is that confusion doesn't have to be bad. It's a <em>normal part of learning new things.</em> It's a sign that you are taking a step in a new direction, outside your comfort zone. It means you are developing new ways of looking at a problem. The sensations of confusion are the "birthing pains" of deeper understanding. They can  be welcomed.
				<blockquote><div class="quote-title">GOOD QUOTE</div>Confusion is the welcome mat on the door of creativity. <div class="quote-sig">Michael Gelb</div></blockquote>
        <h2>Coping strategies</h2>
				<p>So what do you do when you're confused? I recommend using the <em>three A&lsquo;s: awareness, acknowledgement, and affirmation.</em> (Here is <a href="threeas.html">more about the three A&lsquo;s.</a>)</p>
				<p>First, <em>be aware</em> that confusion has started. As simple as this is, it's a very good first step! You will now have the ability to choose your response. If you <em>don't</em> recognize it, then your automatic stressful habits will kick in.</p>
				<blockquote><div class="quote-title">GOOD QUOTE</div> Between stimulus and response there is a space.  In that space is our power to choose our response.  In our response lies our growth and our freedom.   <div class="quote-sig">Victor Frankl</div></blockquote>
				<p>Next, <em>acknowledge</em> the difficulty of the situation. The feeling is not your fault. You didn't decide the curriculum. You have your own interests and goals and they may not need math. To carry on studying math takes a kind of courage. A math class may not seem to be a truly &ldquo;traumatic&rdquo; experience, but don't underestimate the strength it takes to maintain a positive attitude and stay open to learning.</p>
				<blockquote><div class="quote-title">GOOD QUOTE</div>Courage is not having the strength to go on; it is going on when you don't have the strength. <div class="quote-sig">Theodore Roosevelt</div></blockquote>
				<p><em>Also acknowledge</em> that confusion is a normal part of learning. You are not the only student in the class who sometimes experiences confusion. In fact, it is guaranteed that every other student does.</p>
				<blockquote><div class="quote-title">GOOD QUOTE</div> If you're not confused, you're not paying attention. <div class="quote-sig">Tom Peters, management guru</div></blockquote>
				<p>Next, <em>affirm</em> your basic ability to go forward from here. You may not feel that you know much, but I am sure you have been exposed to many math ideas and you have absorbed a lot of them. I bet you know more than you realize.</p>
				<h2>Take baby steps</h2>
				<blockquote><div class="quote-title">Good Quote</div>The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones. <div class="quote-sig">Confucius</div></blockquote>
				<p>One way to access your deep abilities is to <em>slow down</em> and start looking for <em>baby steps</em>. Here are examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Let your eyes move over the problem. Be curious about patterns, about the appearances of things. Give yourself a chance to learn new ways of using your vision.</li>
          <li>Ask yourself if there is anything familiar in the problem. Find one familiar element, however simple it is.</li>
          <li>Ask yourself what is <em>unfamiliar</em> in the problem. Just recognizing and acknowledging the difficult spot is important.</li>
          <li>Flip through your notes or look in the textbook. Flip, flip. Baby step, baby step.</li>
          <li>Copy the problem onto a blank page. Just get the pencil moving.</li>
          <li>Take a guess at the next step. Write it down. Don't be afraid of wrong guesses.</li>
          <li>Brainstorm. Continue to ask yourself what is familiar and what is unfamiliar.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You might think that baby steps like these will get you no closer to the solution. But even advanced mathematicians take baby steps. Maybe they do it in their heads quickly and their brilliant answer <em>seems</em> to come out of nowhere. But all creative work &mdash;and math problem-solving is a kind of creativity&mdash;involves awareness of simple patterns and small steps for exploration.</p>
        <p>You are not bad at math if you have to proceed in baby steps. Your capability is not limited. You will get there.</p>
