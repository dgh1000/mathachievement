        <!-- h1>MISSION STATEMENT</h1 -->
        <p><span class="lead-in">I offer private tutoring sessions </span> in high school and college math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, and calculus. My goal is to promote a deeper understanding of math problem solving, equipping my students with tools to help them in both their current math classes and future math classes. In the Pasadena, California area I will come to your home. In other areas, I can provide online sessions. <a href="contact.php">Contact Mike</a> for more information.</p>
