        <span class="lead-in">Let me extend a welcome</span> to all students
        who would like to gain new capabilities and confidence at math. This
        site presents essays and ideas that can help you, wehther math is a
        struggle or you naturally excel at it. </p>
      <p><span class="lead-in"> If you excel</span> at math, I recommend you
      begin <a href="excel.html">at this page.</a>
      <p><span class="lead-in"> If you struggle</span> with math, continue
      reading. First, let me acknowledge the situation. Math really is
      difficult and seems disconnected from anything else in life that you may
      care about. If you are discouraged that you have to take many math
      classes in order to graduate, that is understandable. </p>
      <p> <img src="img/brain-03.png" class="float-left-image"
      alt=""/><span class="lead-in">Your brain can do math.</span> I know that
      you have the brain cells to do it. <em>Your brain is a tool.</em> When
      you use a tool like a screwdriver, you have to use it in the right
      way. <img class="float-right-image" src="img/screwdriver-03.png"/> You
      wouldn't hold a screwdriver by the shaft and turn the screw with the
      handle: that wouldn't work very well. It may be that you aren't using
      your brain very effectively for math right now. </p>
      <p> <span class="lead-in">First</span>, read <a href="journey.html">the
      journey</a> which presents math problem solving as navigating your way
      through an unfamiliar territory to reach your home. You already know a
      lot about navigating through the world, like finding a new restaurant in
      a new neighborhood. We can take that perspective and harness it for
      math. </p>
      <p><span class="lead-in">Second</span>, you probably know a lot about
      manipulating the world. You know how to rearrange things to achieve a
      goal, like straightening up a room. As a child you learned to build
      things out of blocks. You probably feel some sense of power and control
      in the "physical universe," the world of objects. Math is a "universe"
      that also it contains objects which you can rearrange and you can build
      with. Read <a href="make.html">make it so</a> to gain confidence in
      manipulating the world of math: if you wish it to be done, then in the
      words of Captain Picard, you can "make it so." </p>
      <p> <span class="lead-in">When</span> you are
      ready, <a href="contact.php">Contact me</a> for private lessons. We can
      work on homework problems, or prepare you for a test. Additionally, we
      can work toward a deeper and fuller understanding. </p>
